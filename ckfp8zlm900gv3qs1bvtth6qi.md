## The anxiety of modern developers.

Every year 😃, there’s something new to learn and play with in the web development  space that’s considered something you must use: React, Vue, GraphQL, Docker,Laravel etc. They claim you’ll become a modern developer 🤷‍♂️  .

The obsession with finding better frameworks is killing ideas before they reach the world, and nobody’s really talking about it.
  *By OWEN WILLIAMS.*



This has always been the case on the web, too many technology run on it , and the current web stack might might not be supported by the community,as much as it used to be 😤.  manyatimes its considered old-school 😟. 
but I don’t remember it ever feeling this awful.



In our quest for something more modern, we’ve created a mess of developer tooling and ruined the experience of building up the first version of a really great idea 💡. well maybe not so great,but it can be better with the second version 😏.



** But, this has all made me wonder: has the modern stack killed experimentation, and shipping bad ideas 🤔 ? Do weird experiments and fun ideas die on the floor, tangled in complexity, more often now 😬? I’d hazard a guess that the answer is yes, and that you should probably skip that hipster framework—for now—as well. Just ship something instead.**
