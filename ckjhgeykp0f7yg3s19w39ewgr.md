## Role-Based Access Control ( RBAC) for NoSQL DB in Nodejs


> Many RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementations differ, but the basics are widely adopted since it simulates real-life role (job) assignments.  - *[Onur YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m](https://github.com/onury).*

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of modifying access and privileges based on the roles of individual users or user groups within an organization.

RBAC lets members of an organization have access, to only the resources they need to do their jobs and restricts or prevents unlimited privileges to resources that don't pertain to them.

### RBAC vs ABAC
Role-based access control and attribute-based access control (ABAC) are both types of access control methods, but their approaches are different.
A use case that necessitates an RBAC system, would be if we intend to grant privileges on the application depending on the roles of users.

While ABAC grants access based on a combination of attributes, i.e., user attributes, resource attributes, attributes associated with the system or application to be accessed,  environmental attributes, and so on. For example, User attributes may include biodata information, uniquely identifies, role, security clearance, and etc.

### Back Story
On a recent project, my team was tasked with implementing a custom  Role-based access control framework for MongoDB(NoSQL DB), using the mongoose ORM schema.
In this access control framework we'll be considering 3 entities :
1. Roles
2. User
3. Resources

** Implementation context**
 
- The User has a Role
- The Application has defined Resources and,
- The role has privileges & permissions to Resources 

let's write some  mongoose schema's for our collections ðŸ˜„

### Schema 
** resources.models.js **
```
/* RBAC - role-based access control
 first create roles; role =[ "user", "guest", "organization",  "superadmin" "globalsuperadmin"]
 next, create resouuce, add their roles_id and permmissions
 finally create users and indcate thier roles
*/

    const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');
    const { Schema } = mongooseClient;

    const resources = new Schema({
      name: { type: String, required: true },
      slug: { type: String, required: true },
      resources_roles: [{
        roles_id: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref : 'Roles' },
        roles_name: { type:  String },
        create: { type: Boolean },
        delete: { type: Boolean },
        update: { type: Boolean },
        read: { type: Boolean },
      }]
    }, {
      timestamps: true
    });
  
    return mongooseClient.model('resources', resources);
```

** roles.models.js **
```
 

   const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');
    const { Schema } = mongooseClient;

  module.exports = function (app) {
    const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');
    const { Schema } = mongooseClient;
    const roles = new Schema({
      name: { type: String, required: true },
      slug: { type: String, required: true },
    }, {
      timestamps: true
    });
  
    return mongooseClient.model('roles', roles);
  };

```

** users.models.js**
```

 const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');
    const { Schema } = mongooseClient;

  
  module.exports = function (app) {
    const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');
    const { Schema } = mongooseClient
    const users = new mongooseClient.Schema({
      email: {type: String, unique: true, lowercase: true},
      password: { type: String },
      first_name: { type: String },
      last_name: { type: String },
      roles: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref : 'Roles' },
  
    }, {
      timestamps: true
    });
  
    return mongooseClient.model('users', users);
  };
```

Now when you want the permissions of a role on a resource, you just look up ```role_id``` and ```resource_id``` and check for which permissions are set to ```true``` in the ```resources collection```.

### Authorization Middleware

``` users.post('/', getAuth, someMethod) ```

Assuming you have a token of some sort on the request that identifies the user making the post, and attaching the user instance to the request object you can do this:

```
// pseudo code
getAuth = function (req, res, next) {
  if(req.user) { 

// query to get the user role's  permissions for a resource
    if(token){
    // handle jwt token authenticity and decrypt payload 
    
   // get permission handler
    db.getPerms({ role_id: req.user.role_id, resource_id: req.resource.id})
    .then((perms) => {
       var allow = false;
       // mapping of methods to permissions
       perms.forEach(function(perm){
           if (req.method == "POST" && perms.create) allow = true;
           else if (req.method == "GET" && perms.read) allow = true;
           else if (req.method == "PUT" && perms.write) allow = true;
           else if (req.method == "DELETE" && perm.delete) allow = true;
    
       })
       if (allow) next();
       else {
            res.status(403).send({error: 'access denied'});
        }
    })
    .catch((err)=> {
       //handle your reject and catch here
    })
} else{
    res.status(400).send({error: 'invalid token'})
} 


```
This is some Pseudo-code, showing how the authentication middleware can be written. 

This isn't the most optimized framework for implementing RBAC, so I'm looking forward to your feedback ðŸ˜„!!
