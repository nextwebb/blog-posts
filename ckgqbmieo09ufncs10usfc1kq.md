## Python Techniques - How to Check If Multiple Keys Exists In A Dictionary?

## Introduction

In Python, dictionaries are written with curly braces ```{}``` and they have one or more unordered key-value pairs. The values of a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, but the keys or names canâ€™t be repeated and must be immutable. 
The implementation of Hash tables or hash maps in python is through the built-in dictionary data-type, as key-value pairs. 


**Example  **

*Create and print a dictionary:*
```
person =	{
  "name": "nextwebb"
  "favColor": "red",
  "hobby": "Gaming"
}
print(person)
```

*Accessing the keys of a dictionary in python*

```
x = person["name"]
 >>>  nextwebb
```

Letâ€™s discuss the subject matter,  which is how to check multiple keys in a dictionary in a single pass?  :

**Method #1  Using sets: **

*According to the [doc.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset)*

> A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.

In our case, we can make the input values or arguments into a set object, and check if the given set,  is a subset or superset of another set. The resulting output will be  ```True or False ``` depending on the elements present in the sets.

*here's an example:* 
```
# dictionary or hashmap in python
person =	{
  "name": "nextwebb",
  "favColor": "red",
  "hobby": "Gaming"
}

if set(("name", "favColor")) <= set(person):
   pass 

```
*Alternatively*

```
if set(("name", "favColor")).issubset(person):
   pass 
```

**Method #2  Using if, all statement: **

In this method, we will check if all the key elements that we want to compare can be found in the above dictionary or not.

```
if all (key in person for key in ("name", "favColor")):
    pass

```

There you go, with two elegant methods to check for multiple keys in a dictionary or hashtable in python ðŸ˜€ .
