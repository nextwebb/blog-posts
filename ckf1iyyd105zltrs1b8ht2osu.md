## Setup Social Authentication In Django Rest Framework

With the Global surge in internet users, as well as  people embracing and gaining access to digital products, It's become the goal of many applications to bring the best user experience and retain many guest users. 
Social Authentication aims at simplifying the login process for visitors, thus leading to a higher conversion rate on user registrations. 


Some advantages include: 
- Faster registration
- One login credentials less to remember
- less failed login attempts.
- Easier mobile experience.
- The user experience can be more personalized and directed.

And the list goes on.

### Backstory
I recently needed to implement social login API's for Google and Facebook social providers. I had a lot of attempts to get it working and talking with the client application, but it proved challenging ðŸ˜§ . 

Alas we got the Social Auth API's communicating with the client application ðŸ˜Š and in this tutorial I will show you how to easily  implement Facebook social login.

**Assumptions.** The reader has some experience with Python, Django Rest Framework and API's. 

Integrating a social Authentication to the  server-side of an application requires:
- A selected social authentication provider
- A  log in request to the social authentication provider
- An authentication token from login, so as to access protected API routes.

Before getting started, 
- Head to [Facebook developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) page
- Create a social App 
- On the dashboard, settings >> basic, add â€˜app domainâ€™ and â€˜site urlâ€™ which can be any url and remember to set the URL in the `/etc/hosts` file in your local machine. 
- Copy the FACEBOOK_APP_ID and the FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET and set them as environment variables in your projectâ€™s .env file.

All set, let's configure our Django application;

In this project we'll be working with the [ django-rest-auth](https://django-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) library.
The package aims to simplify registration and authentication tasks, by providing a set of REST API endpoints .

1.)   Install  django-rest-auth package:

```
pip install django-rest-auth
```

2.)   Add rest_auth app to INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.py:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    ...,
    'rest_auth'
)
```


3.)  Add rest_auth urls:

```
urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    path('api/<version>/rest-auth/', include('rest_auth.urls'))
]

```
4.)  We need to install the [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) package as well, because we need to enable a standard registration process.
```
pip install django-allauth
```
5.)  Add django.contrib.sites, allauth, allauth.account and rest_auth.registration apps to INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.py:
````
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'rest_auth.registration',
)
````

6.)  Add SITE_ID = 1 to your django settings.py
```
SITE_ID = 1
```
7.)  Add rest_auth.registration urls:
```
urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    path('api/<version>/rest-auth/', include('rest_auth.urls')),
    path('api/<version>/rest-auth/registration/', include('rest_auth.registration.urls'))
]
```
8.)    Add allauth.socialaccount and allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook or allauth.socialaccount.providers.twitter apps to INSTALLED_APPS in your django settings.py:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'rest_auth'
    ...,
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'rest_auth.registration',
    ...,
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook'

)
```

9.)   Add Social Application in Django admin panel

10.)   Create new view as a subclass of rest_auth.registration.views.SocialLoginView:

```
from allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook.views import FacebookOAuth2Adapter
from rest_auth.registration.views import SocialLoginView

class FacebookLogin(SocialLoginView):
    adapter_class = FacebookOAuth2Adapter

```

11.)   Create url for FacebookLogin view:

```
urlpatterns += [
    
    path('api/<version>/rest-auth/facebook/', FacebookLogin.as_view(), name='fb_login'),
]

 ```
let's test the API without any Authentication token and get the appropriate response:

  TaDa!!!  The backend social Auth configuration is all set and ready for communication with the client application. 

 Hopefully you can improve the user experience of your applications by supporting more social Authentication providers ðŸ¤“.
